Originally the event was scheduled to be held in Australia from 18 October to 15 November 2020,[10][11][12] but in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that this tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[13][14][15] In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India would host the 2021 tournament as planned, with Australia being named as the host for the succeeding 2022 tournament.[16] However, in June 2021, the ICC announced that the tournament had been moved to the United Arab Emirates due to growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic situation in India, and a possible third wave of the pandemic in the country.[17] The tournament began on 17 October 2021,[5] with the tournament's final taking place on 14 November 2021.[18] The preliminary rounds of the tournament were played in the UAE and Oman.[19]
